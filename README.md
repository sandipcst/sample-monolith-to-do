Explanation of Monolithic Characteristics in this Example:

    Single Codebase: All functionalities (user registration, login, to-do management) are within the app.py file.
    Centralized Deployment: The entire application is deployed as a single unit.
    Tight Coupling: The user management and to-do list functionalities are directly integrated and share the same in-memory data structures (though in a real app, this would be a database). Changes in one part could potentially impact others.

This example, while simplified, demonstrates the core principles of a monolithic application where all functionalities are bundled together.
