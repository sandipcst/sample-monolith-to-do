# Note: For a production environment, you would need to set up a proper database connection and use a more robust authentication system.

# To run the microservices and the main application, you would use commands like:
# $ uvicorn todo_service.app:app --reload
# $ uvicorn user_service.app:app --reload
# $ uvicorn app.py --reload

# To deploy them in Kubernetes, you would need to create Docker images for each service and configure Kubernetes deployments and services.

# This is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept of microservices. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many other factors like error handling, logging, security, etc.
